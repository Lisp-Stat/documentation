The first thing you'll need to decide is what IDE you want to use.  Traditionally Common Lisp developers use emacs and a connection to lisp like slime/swank for an interactive experience.  However emacs, whilst powerful, presents a steep learning curve, so if you prefer a GUI based IDE you should start there.  For detailed instructions, see the following from the [cl-cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/):
