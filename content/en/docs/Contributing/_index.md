{{% pageinfo %}}

This section describes the mechanics of _how_ to contribute code to
Lisp-Stat at a high level. Legal stuff, community guidelines, code of
conduct, etc. For details on how to contribute code and documentation,
see links on nav sidebar to the left under Contributing.

For ideas about _what_ you might contribute, please see
open issues on github and the [ideas](ideas) page. The
[organisation repository](https://github.com/Lisp-Stat) contains the
individual sub-projects. Contributions to
[documentation](https://github.com/Lisp-Stat/documentation) are
especially welcome.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are common and accepted in open
source projects.  We all wish for Lisp-Stat to be used and distributed
as widely as possible, and for its users to be confident about the
origins and continuing existence of the code.  The CLA help us achieve
that goal.

The Lisp-Stat project uses CLAs to accept regular contributions from
individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing
software products, for example if you wished to contribute a large
XLISP-STAT library.

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute
your contributions as part of the project.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you have already
submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably
do not need to do it again. To get the process started, download and
sign the CLA ([A4](/Individual-Contributor-License-A4.pdf),
[US-Letter](/Individual-Contributor-License-US-Letter.pdf)), then, in
your PR (pull request), include a copy in a /LICENSE directory of the
repository, creating the directory if it doesn't exist. This needs to
be done only once per contributor.


## Code of Conduct

The following code of conduct is not meant as a means for punishment,
action or censorship for the mailing list or project. Instead, it is
meant to set the tone, expectations and comfort level for contributors
and those wishing to participate in the community.

- We ask everyone to be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
- Flame wars and insults are unacceptable in any fashion, by any party.
- Anything can be asked, and "RTFM" is not an acceptable answer.
- Neither is "it's in the archives, go read them".
- Statements made by core developers can be quoted outside of the list.
- Statements made by others can not be quoted outside the list without explicit permission. - Anonymised paraphrased statements "someone asked about..." are OK - direct quotes with or without names are not appropriate.
- The community administrators reserve the right to revoke the subscription of members (including mentors) that persistently fail to abide by this Code of Conduct.
