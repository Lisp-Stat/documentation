  How to contribute to Lisp-Stat

{{% pageinfo %}}

This section describes the mechanics of _how_ to contribute code to
Lisp-Stat. Legal requirements, community guidelines, code of
conduct, etc. For details on how to contribute code and documentation,
see links on nav sidebar to the left under Contributing.

For ideas about _what_ you might contribute, please see
open issues on github and the [ideas](ideas) page. The
[organisation repository](https://github.com/Lisp-Stat) contains the
individual sub-projects. Contributions to
[documentation](https://github.com/Lisp-Stat/documentation) are
especially welcome.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are common and accepted in open
source projects.  We all wish for Lisp-Stat to be used and distributed
as widely as possible, and for its users to be confident about the
origins and continuing existence of the code.  The CLA help us achieve
that goal. Although common, many in the Lisp community are unaware of
CLA or their importance. Some often asked questions include:

### Why do you need a CLA?

We need a CLA because, by law, all rights reside with the originator
of a work unless otherwise agreed. The CLA allows the project to
accept and distribute your contributions. Without your consent via a
CLA, the project has no rights to ues the code. Here's what Google has
to say in their [CLA policy page](https://opensource.google/docs/cla/policy/):

*Standard inbound license*

*Using one standard inbound license that grants the receiving company broad permission to use contributed code in products is beneficial to the company and downstream users alike.*

*Technology companies will naturally want to make productive use of any code made available to them. However, if all of the code being received by a company was subject to various inbound licenses with conflicting terms, the process for authorizing the use of the code would be cumbersome because of the need for constant checks for compliance with the various licenses. Whenever contributed code were to be used, the particular license terms for every single file would need to be reviewed to ascertain whether the application would be permitted under the terms of that code’s specific license. This would require considerable human resources and would slow down the engineers trying to utilize the code.*

*The benefits that a company receives under a standard inbound license pass to downstream users as well. Explicit patent permissions and disclaimers of obligations and warranties clarify the recipients’ rights and duties. The broad grant of rights provides code recipients opportunities to make productive use of the software. Adherence to a single standard license promotes consistency and common understanding for all parties involved.*


### Why do I have to sign?

In order to be legally binding a certain amount of legal ceremony
must take place. This varies by jurisdiction. In some places,
'[clickwrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap)' or '[browse
wrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browse_wrap)' agreements are used,
however these are gray areas of legal validity. A 'wet signature' is
valid everywhere and avoids ambiguity of assent.

### What does it do?

The CLA essentially does three things. It ensures that the contributor agrees:

1. To allow the project to use the source code and redistribute it
2. The contribution is theirs to give, e.g. does not belong to their employer or someone else
3. Does not contain any patented 'stuff'.

### How long will it take?

The entire process should take less than an hour. 30-40 minutes is
typical.

### Mechanics of the CLA
The Lisp-Stat project uses CLAs to accept regular contributions from
individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing
software products, for example if you wished to contribute a large
XLISP-STAT library.

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute
your contributions as part of the project.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you have already
submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably
do not need to do it again. To get the process started, download and
sign the CLA ([A4](/Individual-Contributor-License-A4.pdf),
[US-Letter](/Individual-Contributor-License-US-Letter.pdf)), then, in
your PR (pull request), include a copy in a /LICENSE directory of the
repository, creating the directory if it doesn't exist. This needs to
be done only once per contributor.


## Code of Conduct

The following code of conduct is not meant as a means for punishment,
action or censorship for the mailing list or project. Instead, it is
meant to set the tone, expectations and comfort level for contributors
and those wishing to participate in the community.

- We ask everyone to be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
- Flame wars and insults are unacceptable in any fashion, by any party.
- Anything can be asked, and "RTFM" is not an acceptable answer.
- Neither is "it's in the archives, go read them".
- Statements made by core developers can be quoted outside of the list.
- Statements made by others can not be quoted outside the list without explicit permission. - Anonymised paraphrased statements "someone asked about..." are OK - direct quotes with or without names are not appropriate.
- The community administrators reserve the right to revoke the subscription of members (including mentors) that persistently fail to abide by this Code of Conduct.
