These notebooks describe how to undertake statistical analyses introduced as examples in the Ninth Edition of _Introduction to the Practices of Statistics_ (2017) by Moore, McCabe and Craig. The notebooks are organised in the same manner as the chapters of the book. The data comes from the site [IPS9 in R](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/) by Nicholas Horton.

The notebooks are implemented using a third-party library,
[common-lisp-jupyter](https://github.com/yitzchak/common-lisp-jupyter)
and are known to work with revision `b1021ab`.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}Be careful when upgrading `common-lisp-jupyter`. Breaking changes are often introduced without warning. The last known working revision will be noted above and kept up to date.
