  Using Lisp-Stat in the real world
---

One of the best ways to learn Lisp-Stat is to see examples of actual work. This section contains example notebooks illustrating statistical analysis. These notebooks describe how to undertake statistical analyses introduced as examples in the _Ninth Edition of Introduction to the Practices of Statistics_ (2017) by Moore, McCabe and Craig. The notebooks are organised in the same manner as the chapters of the book. The data comes from the site [IPS9 in R](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/) by Nicholas Horton.

To run the notebooks yourself you can use a ready made online notebook:

Or checkout the [IPS9 repo](https://github.com/Lisp-Stat/IPS9) and [all of the examples](https://lisp-stat.github.io/IPS9/).


## Part I: Looking at Data

* [Chapter 1 &ndash; Distributions](/docs/examples/distributions/)
	: Exploratory data analysis using plots and numbers
* [Chapter 2 &ndash; Data Relationships](/docs/examples/data-relationships/)
	: Examining relationships between variables

We also include plotting examples from the [Vega-Lite example gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).
