  Selecting Cartesian subsets of data

## Overview {#Overview}

Select provides:

1.  An API for taking slices (elements selected by the Cartesian
    product of vectors of subscripts for each axis) of array-like
    objects.  The most important function is `select`. Unless you want
    to define additional methods for `select`, this is pretty much
    all you need from this library.  See the [API reference](https://lisp-stat.github.io/select/) for
    additional details.
2.  An extensible DSL for selecting a subset of valid
    subscripts.  This is useful if, for example, you want to resolve
    column names in a data frame in your implementation of select.
3.  A set of utility functions for traversing selections in
    array-like objects.

It combines the functionality of dplyr's _slice_ and _select_ methods.

## Basic Usage {#Using}

The most frequently used form is:

<a id="code-snippet--simple-select-example"></a>
```lisp
(select object selection1 selection2 ...)
```

where each `selection` specifies a set of subscripts along the
corresponding axis.  The selection specifications are found below.

To select a column, pass in `t` for the rows `selection1`, and the
columns names (for a data frame) or column number (for an array) for
`selection2`.  For example, to select the first column of this array:

```lisp
(select #2A((C0  C1  C2)
            (v10 v11 v12)
		    (v20 v21 v22)
		    (v30 v31 v32))
  t 1)
; #(C1 V11 V21 V31)
```

and to select a column from the `mtcars` data frame:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :data-frame)
(data :mtcars)
(select mtcars t 'mpg)
```

if you're selecting from a data frame, you can also use the `column`
or `columns` command:

```lisp
(column mtcars 'mpg)
```

to select an entire row, pass `t` for the column selector, and the
row(s) you want for `selection1`.  This example selects the first row
(second row in purely array terms, which are 0 based):

```lisp
(select #2A((C0  C1  C2)
            (v10 v11 v12)
		    (v20 v21 v22)
		    (v30 v31 v32))
  1 t)
;#(V10 V11 V12)
```


## Selection Specifiers {#selection-specifiers}


### Selecting Single Values {#selecting-single-values}

A non-negative integer selects the corresponding index, while a
negative integer selects an index counting backwards from the last
index.  For example:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-single-value"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3) 1)                  ; => 1
(select #(0 1 2 3) -2)                 ; => 2
```

These are called _singleton_ slices.  Each singleton slice drops the
dimension: vectors become atoms, matrices become vectors, etc.


### Selecting Ranges {#selecting-ranges}

`(range start end)` selects subscripts _i_ where start <= i < end.
When end is `nil`, the last index is included (cf. subseq).  Each
boundary is resolved according to the other rules, if applicable, so
you can use negative integers:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-range"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3) (range 1 3))         ; => #(1 2)
(select #(0 1 2 3) (range 1 -1))        ; => #(1 2)
```


### Selecting All Subscripts {#selecting-all-subscripts}

_t_ selects all subscripts:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-all"></a>
```lisp
(select #2A((0 1 2)
	        (3 4 5))
	 t 1)                           ; => #(1 4)
```


### Selecting w/ Sequences {#selecting-w-sequences}

Sequences can be used to make specific selections from the object.  For example:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-with-sequence"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
	(vector (range 1 3) 6 (range -2 -1))) ; => #(1 2 3 6 8 9)

(select #(0 1 2) '(2 2 1 0 0))                ; => #(2 2 1 0 0)
```

## Masks

### Bit Vectors {#bit-vectors-as-mask}

Bit vectors can be used to select elements of arrays and sequences
as well:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-bitmask"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3 4) #*00110)          ; => #(2 3)
```

### Which
`which` returns an index of the positions in SEQUENCE which satisfy PREDICATE.

```lisp
(defparameter data
  #(12 127 28 42 39 113 42 18 44 118 44 37 113 124 37 48 127 36 29 31 125
   139 131 115 105 132 104 123 35 113 122 42 117 119 58 109 23 105 63 27
   44 105 99 41 128 121 116 125 32 61 37 127 29 113 121 58 114 126 53 114
   96 25 109 7 31 141 46 13 27 43 117 116 27 7 68 40 31 115 124 42 128 146
   52 71 118 117 38 27 106 33 117 116 111 40 119 47 105 57 122 109 124
   115 43 120 43 27 27 18 28 48 125 107 114 34 133 45 120 30 127 31 116))
(which data :predicate #'evenp)
; #(0 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 13 15 17 25 26 30 31 34 40 44 46 48 55 56 57 59 60 66 71 74
;  75 78 79 80 81 82 84 86 88 91 93 98 100 103 107 108 109 112 113 116 117 120)
```

## Extensions {#extensions}

The previous section describes the core functionality. The semantics
can be extended.  The extensions in this section are provided by the
library and prove useful in practice. Their implementation provide
good examples of extending the library.

`including` is convenient if you want the selection to include the
end of the range:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-including"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3) (including 1 2))
				    ; => #(1 2), cf. (select ... (range 1 3))
```

`nodrop` is useful if you do not want to drop dimensions:

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-including"></a>
```lisp
(select #(0 1 2 3) (nodrop 2))
			; => #(2), cf. (select ... (range 2 3))
```

All of these are trivial to implement. If there is something you are
missing, you can easily extend `select`.  Pull request are
welcome.

`(ref)` is a version of `(select)` that always returns a single
element, so it can only be used with singleton slices.


## Select Semantics {#select-semantics}

Arguments of `select`, except the first one, are meant to be
resolved using `canonical-representation`, in the `select-dev`
package. If you want to extend `select`, you should define methods
for `canonical-representation`. See the source code for the best
examples. Below is a simple example that extends the semantics with
ordinal numbers.

<a id="code-snippet--example-select-including"></a>
```lisp
(defmacro define-ordinal-selection (number)
  (check-type number (integer 0))
  `(defmethod select-dev:canonical-representation
       ((axis integer) (select (eql ',(intern (format nil \"~:@@(~:r~)\" number)))))
     (assert (< ,number axis))
     (select-dev:canonical-singleton ,number)))

(define-ordinal-selection 1)
(define-ordinal-selection 2)
(define-ordinal-selection 3)

(select #(0 1 2 3 4 5) (range 'first 'third)) ; => #(1 2)
```

Note the following:

-   The value returned by `canonical-representation` needs to be
    constructed using `canonical-singleton`, `canonical-range`, or
    `canonical-sequence`. You should not use the internal
    representation directly as it is subject to change.
-   You can assume that `axis` is an integer; this is the
    default. An object may define a more complex mapping (such as, for
    example, named rows & columns), but unless a method specialized to
    that is found, `canonical-representation` will just query its
    dimension (with `axis-dimension`) and try to find a method
    that works on integers.
-   You need to make sure that the subscript is valid, hence the
    assertion.
