  Manuals for Lisp-Stat systems
---

This section describes the core APIs and systems that comprise Lisp-Stat.  These APIs include both the high level functionality described elsewhere, as well as lower level APIs that they are built on.  This section will be of interest to 'power users' and developers who wish to extend Lisp-Stat, or build modules of their own.
